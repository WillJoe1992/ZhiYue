ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

 * Project minimal:/Users/macbookpro/Downloads/minimal/.classpath:
   Could not resolve source path src in project minimal: ignored. The project
   may not compile if the given source path provided source code.


Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => minimal/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* assets/ => minimal/src/main/assets

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
